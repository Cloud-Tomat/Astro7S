### Shooting modes ###

Toggle the mode indicator on the top left to switch between manual and aperture priority mode.
The icon directly below it allows you to cycle between single shot, low speed and high speed burst modes.

### Shooting parameters ###

The following parameters can be configured directly with the 3 knobs: Shutter speed, aperture, ISO.
The enter button allows you to toggle between manual and automatic ISO and set a minimum shutter speed in aperture priority mode.

### Interface ###

Press the UP button to cycle through display modes. This will toggle the histogram, metering display and rule of 3rds grid lines.

### Focus magnification ###

Use the C1/C2 keys to activate focus magnification and zoom in or out. Half-pressing the shutter button ends focus magnification. You can change the position of the preview rectangle by either using the control wheel. 

### Other features ###

The app also includes simple timelapse and exposure bracketing modes. Touch the icon on the left side and follow the on-screen instructions.

Long exposure noise reduction is disabled (normally forced in single in bulb mode on the A7S).

Exit the app using the help/trash button.

The app remembers the configured settings across multiple runs.
